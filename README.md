### Hi there 👋 I'm Niko, a Software Developer 👨‍💻 working remotely from Chile 🇨🇱🏠.

I like to create content and I'm sharing about the technologies that I currently use, experiences and daily life while developing, through my blog and creating community.
I work at Stefanini Latam how Senior Full Stack Developer in a big project of Digital Transformation, raising MVPs and taking them to production for real clients throughout Chile and Latin America.
I have more than 12 years working in the digital world.
I currently work with:


- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- React
- Nextjs
- Tailwindcss
- E2E, Integration and Unit Testing
- Jest
- React Testing Library
- Cypress
- Express / Nest.js
- Java Spring Boot
- GraphQL / API Rest
- MongoDB
- Microservicios
- Github Actions
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- AWS

I love creating new products with friendly user interfaces, with modern architectures, developing with the latest technologies and working in a team.

My favorite stack is: Nextjs + Express + GraphQL + Neo4j + Vercel.
I’m restless about learning more and I like facing new challenges. I’m not afraid of the new.
I’m nerd. I like video games, series, reading books and comics and talking a lot.
